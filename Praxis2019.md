# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each question, then  add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Amanda: I don't think I've had tacos except Tacos Gomez here
* Lauren: Brazos thus far but still on the hunt for best taco champion.
* Janet: Brazos #because I've not had other tacos in CVille
* Natasha: Mono Loco, RIP. It's also the only place in Cville I've had tacos.
* Connor: La Michoacana Taqueria!
* Chloe: Continental Divide carnitas or beef tacos.

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995)
* Brandon: Face/Off or Jupiter Ascending.
* Lauren: Spice World
* Janet: George of the Jungle
* Natasha: Toss-up between Death Becomes Her and But I'm a Cheerleader.
* Connor: Star Wars Attack of the Clones (Episode 2)
* Chloe: I'm allergic to bad movies.

## Best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best is obviously Texas. Iowa and New Mexico are runner-ups. Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
* Amanda: I find the flags that contain the state's written name kind of endearing? Rating the racist flags worst (overt racist references, e.g. Maryland, Mississippi; at least four flags that chose to represent the entire state via two white people, e.g. New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Wisconsin).
* Brandon: I have no thoughts on flags. My petition to get Virginia to put Pepper on their flag continues to be denied, and I refuse to recognize it until they do. 
* Lauren: I am partial to Alaska's for the constellation, and impartial to Maryland's for the cacophany of patterns.
* Janet: My home state of Massachusetts is the worst. It's boring and it basically looks like someone is taking a sword to an Algonquisn Native American who is offering peace. I like the Louisiana state flag because of the pelicans.
* Natasha: Best is California. Worst is Mississippi. 
* Connor: I agree with Natasha that Mississip is the worst. I also think Maryland is pretty great!
* Chloe: Best is New Mexico (though I don't know its history) and Colorado because, well, it's a giant C. Worst is Ohio because asymmetry.

## What are your five favorite things?
* Amanda: dogs, stories (books but also other media with stories e.g. videogames), spending time with friends, making websites, waking up early yet well rested
* Shane: dogs, stories, spending time with friends, leaving Jeremy do the CSS, not sleeping ever  
* Brandon: chocolate chip cookies warm, gooey, and with milk; animals; warm days with a nice breeze; playing/listening to music; time with friends
* Lauren: reading fiction, autumn, bread, foxes, friends
* Janet: Julie Andrews, dark chocolate, dogs, singing, trees
* Natasha: Reading novels, dogs, bagels, tattoos, writing (when I don't hate it).
* Connor: brownies with vanilla ice cream; musicals; soccer; kayaking; telling stories
* Chloe: The sea, lazy saturday mornings with my family, board games with friends, touching works of art(!), also singing. 

## What are your three favorite places you've visited?
* Janet: Yukon, Canada; Cyprus; Tunisia
* Lauren: Glacier National Park (MT), Tuscany, small Michigan lakefront town on Lake Michigan
* Shane: Tunisia, Cuba, Italian Alps.
* Amanda: A tiny forest with very old, very tall trees on the edge of the University of Victoria (British Columbia) campus, sleeping over in the (Chicago) Museum of Science & Industry, getting lost in the Ch√¢teau Frontenac in Quebec
* Natasha: Cambodia, Tibet, the Studio Ghibli Museum outside Tokyo.
Connor: Florence (Italy), Charlelvoix (Canada), Aran Islands (Ireland)
* Chloe: Thanks for confirming so many places I still need to go! Turks & Caicos Islands, Egypt, the Luberon Valley in France, when the linden trees are in full bloom.

## Favorite hiking spots in or near Cville?
* Lauren: This is my question and I am selfishly polling the community so TBD as I begin hiking more.
* Janet: Humpback Rock (I love the historic homestead community you get to walk through before the hike); Crabtree Falls; and I'm doing a new one this weekend (Doyle's River and Jones Run Trail in Shenandoah) 
* Shane: I'm going to risk some ire and say that all the wilderness areas in central Virginia look pretty much the same.
* Amanda: haven't been to any, but Humpback Rock sounds cool, and I would like to hike more!
* Natasha: The only one I've done is the McAfee Knob hike and it was incredible. It's a good couple of hours out from Charlottesville, though.
* Connor: near Cville trails I love include Walnut Creek, Ivy Creek, and Ragged Mountain... Shenandoah Nat Park has some amazing options (Old Rag definitely worth it as long as you don't go on a beautiful weekend day because it gets super crowded). Little farther away but I'm also a big fan of McAfee Knob near Roanoke.
* Chloe: Monticello trail, rip rap trail (I think!), sugar hollow and blue hole

## What's the book/essay/article you wish you'd written?
* Natasha: Rebecca Solnit's essay, The Blue of Distance, and the book it's in, A Field Guide to Getting Lost. And basically anything by Rebecca Solnit.
* Janet: I can't think of an author, but I wish I was Sondheim's librettist.
* Shane: Merritt Roe Smith's *Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology*
* Connor: Bryant Simon's *The Hamlet Fire: A Tragic Story of Cheap Food, Cheap Government and Cheap Lives* was really pretty amazing. Also, *Inventing the "American Way": The Politics of Consensus from the New Deal to the Civil Rights Movement*
* Lauren: I'm diving straight to fiction because that's the origin of my passion for reading...I love anything written in the vein of magical realism. So rather than any specific book, I wish I could produce fiction like the magical realists I adore.
* Chloe: Not a great answer, but to be able to create another world like C.S. Lewis' or Tolkein's would be an interesting accomplishment.

## Who plays you in your upcoming bio-pic?
* Connor: Joseph Gordon Levitt. Obviously. 
* Natasha: I've been told I bear a resemblance to Tamsin Greig (British comedian - watch Black Books if you haven't). Otherwise, I have no idea - but they'd need to have tatts and unruly hair.
* Lauren: Hmmmmmmm, Brie Larson maybe.
* Chloe: Claire Danes [one million question marks]
* Janet: Natalie Portman

## What's your favorite TV series of all time and/or currently?
* Chloe: The Office still makes me laugh out loud every episode. Currently enjoying the newest take on Queen Victoria. 
* Connor: I'm a big fan of the Inspector Lewis (Also Morse, also Endeavour) series on PBS. Used to watch them with my Dad!
* Lauren: PUSHING DAISIES!!
* Janet: Schitt's Creek
* Natasha: It's a total tie between The Americans and Transparent.
