# Some Brandon-Inspired Git Practice
Fill in your answers to each question, then  add a question and answer it!

## Who makes the best tacos in town?
* Shane: Tacos Gomez for carne asada, Cafe Andrade for al pastor.
* Brandon: I will defer to Shane's clear authority in this matter.
* Amanda: I don't think I've had tacos except Tacos Gomez here

## What's your favorite bad movie?
* Shane: The Net (1995)
* Brandon: Face/Off or Jupiter Ascending.

## Best and worst [American state flag designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_U.S._states_and_territories)
* Shane: Best is obviously Texas. Iowa and New Mexico are runner-ups. Worst is Idaho, which incredibly contains the phrase "State of Idaho" twice.
* Amanda: I find the flags that contain the state's written name kind of endearing? Rating the racist flags worst (overt racist references, e.g. Maryland, Mississippi; at least four flags that chose to represent the entire state via two white people, e.g. New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Wisconsin).
* Brandon: I have no thoughts on flags. My petition to get Virginia to put Pepper on their flag continues to be denied, and I refuse to recognize it until they do. 

## What are your five favorite things?
* Amanda: dogs, stories (books but also other media with stories e.g. videogames), spending time with friends, making websites, waking up early yet well rested
* Brandon: chocolate chip cookies warm, gooey, and with milk; animals; warm days with a nice breeze; playing/listening to music; time with friends
